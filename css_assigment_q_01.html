        <h5>Web Development</h5>

    <P class="p1">Web development is a broad term for the work involved in developing a websites for the internwt (world Wide web)
        or an internet (a privte network). this can include web design ,webcontent development , client
        liaison,client-side/server -side csricpting , web server and network securityconfiguraation , and ecommerse
        development.
        However , among web professionals , "web development " usually refers to the main non-design aspects of building
        web sites : writing markup and cding.

        web-based internet applicatio electronic business, or social network servicces .
    </P>
    <h5>Web development as an industry </h5>
    <p class="p2">Since the mid-1990s, web development has been one of the fastest growing industries
        in the world. In 1995 there were fewer than 1,000 web development companies in the
        United States, but by 2005 there were over 30,000 such companies[citation needed] in
        the U.S. alone. The growth of this industry is being pushed by large businesses wishing
        to sell products and services to their customers and to automate business workflow.
        </p>

    <h5>Security Considerations </h5>
    <p class="p3">Web development takes into account many security considerations, such as data entry
        error checking through forms, filtering output, and encryption.[1] Malicious practices
        such as SQL injection can be executed by users with ill intent yet with only primitive
        knowledge of web development as a whole. Scripts can be exploited to grant
        unauthorized access to malicious users trying to collect information such as email
        addresses, passwords and protected content like credit card numbers.</p>
